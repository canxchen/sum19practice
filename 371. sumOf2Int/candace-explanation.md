Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1

## Initial Insights
1. what 
2. after like an hour, suddent revelation: 1/2 = 0.5, so 1 + 2 = 1 + 1/2 where "1/1" is 2. which is 3. works for 2 + 3 also.
3. but then, that uses addition, so how? bit manip! in java, the syntax is: 
  1. | == or 
  2. ~ == not
  3. ^ == xor 
  4. & == and
