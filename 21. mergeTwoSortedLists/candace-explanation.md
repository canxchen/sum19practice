[21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)<br/>

## Problem: 
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

## Initial Insights
1. done this before! 2 pointers, at each point, check for smaller. add smaller to new. increment the pointer to the smaller value

## Solution:
1. outlined above

Time: O(N+M)

Space: O(N+M)


## Learned:
1. alot of submissions were fast + took less space: heap solution?
